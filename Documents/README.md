<p> In this project, we created a UI that would allow the users to go on a college tour. The users are given options of the schools that they want to go to and are able to choose...</p>
<ol style="PADDING-LEFT: 50px">
	<li>Set path</li>
	<li>Create a custom trip</li>
</ol>
<p> Meaning that they can choose where they want to start, what schools to travel to in what order, and what school they will stop at.</p>
<br>
<h4> For the User: </h4>
<p> At each school that they visit, they have the option of purchasing the souvenirs of each school from a designated gift shop page and are able to see the current amount they spent at each school. After going through all the schools and their gift shops in the tour, the user is then shown the total distance traveled and the total amount of money spent on the trip.</p>
<br>
<h4> For the admin: </h4>
<p> As an administrator, we are given the option of logging in and changing the database if we choose to. We can add/remove school, gift shop items, and adjust the price of each item for an individual school.
